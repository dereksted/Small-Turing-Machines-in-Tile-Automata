The journal that I found for this research is the journal, ``Natural Computing''.  I know that Dr. Hendricks has published in this journal before with papers in the field of self assembly.  Self assembly is the field in which tile assembly, the topic I am doing research on, is a part of.  There are two templates that are allowed for these journal.  One is for Word and the other is for mathematical content using \LaTeX.  I plan to use the template for $\LaTeX$ as I am using \LaTeX.  The information on the latex template is found here:
